Gyatrul Rinpoche added in.&nbsp; </b><br /><br /></span></i></li>
<li><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Q:  What is the big deal about Rinchen Terdzod, and why does it take so long to give?
<br />A:  Before the extraordinary effort by Jamgon Kongtrul the Great to gather and compile then existing terma into a number of volumes, the work Rinchen Terdzod did not exist.  Rather, were one to want to know all the terma then available in Tibet, one would have to travel, as did Jamgon Kongtrul the Great, to the far reaches of Tibet in all directions, visiting many different monasteries and several caves where yogis practice in order to receive the transmissions and lungs and get the teachings related to each specific terma.  This activity, were one able to even do it, would take at least a decade, if not more. 
     <br /><br />Fortunately for us, Jamgon Kongtrul the Great did the work and the precious termas have been preserved until the present. The fruits of his labor have been gathered together in his compilation of all the terma he received in the treasury known as Rinchen Terdzod, which is one of the five great treasuries attributed to him. 
<br /><br />As to the length of time necessary to give the transmissions, there are over one hundred volumes of empowerments to be given, and this takes time.  Yangthang Tulku Rinpoche has indicated that he can complete the transmission in three months; that said, other lamas might take longer, perhaps even six months or more, to give the transmission.  The time to complete the transmission depends on the speed of the reading by the vajra master, the number of empowerments given each day, the number of people present, and so forth. 
<br /><br /></span></i></li>
<li><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Q: Why should I take the time now to take this when I might be able to take it at another time? 
<br />A: The Rinchen Terdzod is seldom given even in Tibet or India, This is only the second time it is being offered in the USA (with the first time being that of H.H. Penor Rinpoche on the East Coast).  Generally, Tibetans anticipate that they will have it offered to them about once, maybe twice, in their lifetime, and many of them will have to travel long distances in order to participate in the mandala.
     
<br /><br />With that understanding, then the likelihood that Rinchen Terdzod will be given again within your lifetime at a location where you can attend is extremely rare.  Thus, this opportunity should not be passed up and everyone should make an effort to connect with the mandala. 
     
<br /><br />Those who can attend every session will be in direct receipt of the complete transmission and, thus, can claim "receipt of the 'complete Rinchen Terdzod'."  However, those who can only attend a few days or weeks will also receive great blessings and connection to these precious lineage holders.
     
<br /><br />For this latter group and for those who are too distant to attend but who want a stable connection to the mandala throughout, they can do so by contributing as vastly as possible to Orgyen Dorje Den, the sponsor of the program, to cover the costs of the event and for tsok offerings, and by making offerings directly to Yangthang Tulku Rinpoche. <br /><br /> If you are not able to attend yourself, you can also connect to the blessings of the mandala by assisting and supporting those who can. Indeed, any way that you can help or contribute to this powerful transmission through donation, service, or other support, direct or indirect, will make a connection to its tremendous blessings.
 <br /><br /></span></i></li>
<li><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Q:  I can spend only two or three weeks and want to participate in the mandala, how should I choose when to come?
<br />A:  Our goal is to create a tentative schedule of which groups of empowerments may be given on a particular day or week.  Then, participants can make an informed decision on when they would like to attend.  The sequence of empowerments will be posted on this website and updated when possible. Please check the &ldquo;Wang&rdquo; section regularly.
<br /><br /> Please keep in mind that the vajra master will decide which empowerments are given on any day and, since this is the case, the schedule may change at any point. <br /><br /> Gyatrul Rinpoche encourages all of his students to attend, whether for a day, a week, a few weekends, or the entire event. He says, &ldquo;This is the first Rinchen Terdzod in California, and it is an amazing blessing and benefit to everybody who comes, to everybody in California, and in the future to everybody in the whole country, the world, everything. That kind of blessing. If people are really busy, even if they can only come one day, or receive one empowerment--we don't know how many blessings are there. At least get one wang if you can, and connect. And if you are able to come and get the whole thing, then if you have faith you can get all 108 tertons' blessings. It is that kind of transmission.&rdquo;
<br /><br />Rinpoche has encouraged everyone to try to attend the first two days of the event (December 1st and 2nd), because they will include preparatory empowerments that will support all of the subsequent empowerments. However, if this is not possible, it is acceptable to attend later empowerments without having been present for these two days. 
<br /><br /></span></i></li>
<li><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Q: So, what is to be expected on any day I show up?
<br />A: This depends on several factors.  Some days, the vajra master will give up to thirteen or more relatively concise wangs; other days, the vajra master might be required to spend the entire day giving all the components of an elaborate wang.  The variety keeps the event stimulating throughout.
     
<br /><br />There can be no mistaking the fact that the process of Rinchen Terdzod might be compared to a very demanding marathon, one that requires enormous devotion and tremendous effort in time and costs.
<br /><br /></span></i></li>
<li><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Q: Why will I be turned away if I do not have the preparatory wangs from the day before?
<br />A: Those that do not have the preparation from the day before may be unable to join the mandala and may be asked to wait outside, where possible, until that wang is completed&mdash;this is still to be discussed with Yangthang Rinpoche. Check the &ldquo;Wang&rdquo; section of this site for updates<br /><br /></span></i></li>
