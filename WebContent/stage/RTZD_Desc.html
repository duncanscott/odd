<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Brief Explanation of the Rinchen Terzod<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The Rinchen Terzod (the Precious Treasury of Terma) 
is one of the most sacred and important sets of transmissions of the Nyingma 
School of Tibetan Buddhism. In the Nyingma, or Early Translation School, great 
masters such as Guru Rinpoche, Vimalamitra, and Vairotsana, among others, gave 
teachings which were concealed during their own time and later discovered by 
eminent masters who came between the 11th and 19th centuries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In the late 19th century, in an effort to save 
these precious works from permanent obscurity, they were collected into the 
Rinchen Terzod, comprised of 64 volumes of Tibetan text. This collection was 
described by the 15th Gyalwang Karmapa as "the quintessence of the ocean-like 
teachings of the [Awakened Ones], the profound [collection of the Awareness 
Holders] of the Early Translation School." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The empowerment rituals of the Rinchen Terzod are 
rarely performed, as they take 3-6 months to complete; this cycle of 
empowerments has only been given once before in the Western world, by Kyabje 
Penor Rinpoche in 1988. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style9"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> The Subject of the Rinchen Terzod<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It is generally considered that Padmasambhava, 
known familiarly to Tibetan Buddhists as Guru Rinpoche, was the primary Indian 
master responsible for establishing Buddhism in Tibet in the 8th century. Other 
major figures who contributed, especially to the establishment of the innermost 
teachings of the Buddha known as the Vajrayana, were another Indian master named 
Vimalamitra and the Tibetan translator Vairochana. In addition, Guru Rinpoche 
had 25 greatly accomplished disciples, among whom was Tibet's king, Trisong 
Deutsen, and a woman considered to be the foremost of these 25, Yeshe Tsogyal. <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Tibetan Buddhist religious history tells us that 
Guru Rinpoche, with enlightened foresight, understood that there were many 
teachings that would benefit future generations more than the people of his own 
time. Guru Rinpoche and Yeshe Tsogyal together concealed these teachings, along 
with many sacred objects, in various places throughout Tibet. Guru Rinpoche then 
taught his 25 disciples particular aspirational prayers to be recited so that in 
future incarnations they would discover these teachings at the appropriately 
beneficial time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">From Sangye Lama in the 11th century up to the 
present day, the discoverers of these teachings have been known as tert&ouml;ns 
&mdash;treasure revealers. The teachings and sacred objects that they discovered are 
known as terma&mdash;treasures. It is these terma, generally unique to the Nyingma 
school, that form the subject of the Rinchen Terzod. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> How the Rinchen Terzod was Compiled<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In the 19th century, three great masters who would 
be directly responsible for the Rinchen Terzod were born in eastern Tibet: 
Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892), Chokgyur Lingpa (1829-1870), and Jamg&ouml;n 
Kongtrul Lodr&ouml; Thaye. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Chokgyur Lingpa became 
treasure revealers of wide renown. Jamgon Kongtrul was a heart disciple of both 
of these lamas, and received all of their treasure teachings as well as many 
more. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Jamgon Kongtrul became alarmed by the possibility 
of many of the profound terma, especially the older ones, being lost to this 
world. At first he gathered many of them into a 10-volume collection known as 
the Small Precious Treasury. Asking his teacher Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo about 
putting together a larger collection of as many of the extant terma as possible, 
it was agreed this was a crucial task, and Jamgon Kongtrul the one to perform 
it. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo even rediscovered some of the lost teachings and 
entrusted them to Jamgon Kongtrul, along with the injunction that he should 
gather as many of the others as he could. The importance of this endeavor was 
further confirmed in a letter to Jamgon Kongtrul from Chokgyur Lingpa, saying he 
had had a direct vision of Guru Rinpoche who told him to give his own terma 
appropriately, and that Jamgon Kongtrul was the right recipient. <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">With both of his teachers' blessings, Jamgon 
Kongtrul devoted much of the rest of his life to creating the Rinchen Terzod. 
Patiently undergoing great hardship, Jamgon Kongtrul traveled all over Tibet. He 
himself received the necessary empowerments and reading transmissions for the 
various terma from contemporary lineage holders, as well as collecting copies of 
the texts. When completed, the Rinchen Terzod totaled 64 volumes of terma from a 
wide range of treasure revealers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> The Purpose of Compiling the Rinchen Terzod<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Through the 1000-year history of the terma 
teachings in Tibet, there was a tendency for practitioners to focus on the terma 
which had been more recently discovered. Thus, the practice of some of the 
profound, older terma had gone into decline. In some cases, their lineages had 
been lost altogether. Additionally, some terma teachings had been discovered and 
were practiced in very remote, lightly populated regions of Tibet, and for this 
reason were under threat of extinction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As a result of Jamgon Kongtrul's great efforts to 
assemble all of these terma into the Rinchen Terzod, many of Tibetan Buddhism's 
highest teaching cycles were safeguarded from disappearing altogether, and 
preserved for the benefit of future generations of Tibetan Buddhist 
practitioners. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> Additional Information about Terma (Treasure Teachings)<br /> <br /> </span></b> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">According to traditional 
explanation, a brief description of terma (the "treasure teachings" of Tibetan 
Buddhism) </span> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">consists of five categories:</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="style12"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> The Identification of Terma<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The literal meaning of ter is "inexhaustible." 
Certain accomplished masters, with great wisdom and compassion for future 
generations, were said to have the power to seal into invisibility profound 
teachings, ritual objects, and valuable substances until the propitious time for 
their rediscovery. The authentic terma are thought to provide special blessings 
due to their unbroken lineage, pure origins, unchanged words, and perfect 
meanings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Particularly in Tibet, terma are mostly associated 
with Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche), the Indian master credited with establishing 
Buddhism in Tibet in the 8th century. With his spiritual consort and foremost 
disciple Yeshe Tsogyal, he traveled throughout Tibet to conceal terma. In 
general, it is said that he concealed 108 major terma, 1000 minor terma, and 
innumerable others scattered across the Tibetan plateau. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The discoverers of these terma are always 
incarnations of one of Guru Rinpoche's 25 most accomplished disciples, who made 
specific aspirational prayers just for this purpose. Three of the earliest 
tert&ouml;ns were Sangye Lama (1000-1080), Nyangral Nyima Oser (1124-1192) and Guru 
Chowang (1212-1270). The phenomenon of terma revelation, transmission, and 
practice has continued until the present day. Such cycles of revelation, 
appearing as very fresh, pure methods to swiftly accomplish supreme 
enlightenment, are known as the Close Lineage of Treasures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> The Lineage of Terma<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In Buddhist cosmology, our present era is known as 
a degenerate time. In such a time, enlightenment teachings can be subject to the 
interpolation of contradictory instructions, impure practice, and other 
interference throughout the generations such that they lose their potency or 
effectiveness, or the lineage becomes lost altogether. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The terma teachings are Guru Rinpoche's uniquely 
skillful method for counteracting the degenerate times. Their periodic arising 
ensures that efficient techniques for experiencing the true nature of mind 
beyond suffering, with the full strength of their blessings intact, are always 
available to sentient beings seeking to liberate themselves and others. <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Depending on how they are counted, there are six, 
seven, or nine methods for transmitting terma lineages. The first 
three&mdash;Mind-to-Mind, Symbolic Indication, and Aural Transmission&mdash;make up the 
first three, and when The Secret Entrustment of the Dakinis, The Bestowal of 
Empowerment Along with Aspiration, and The Yellow Parchment Word Transmission 
are added, this makes six. If this last is eliminated, and the Transmission of 
Spiritual Connection and The Blessed Transmission of Experience are added, this 
becomes seven. Adding an addition two&mdash;The Unadorned Aural Lineage and The 
Practice of the Four-fold Activities Transmission&mdash;are folded in, this makes nine 
methods of terma transmission altogether. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> The Categorization of Terma<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It is said that in reality there are innumerable 
kinds of terma with techniques for liberating innumerable sentient beings with 
their various mental dispositions. For the sake of expediency, however, the 
following general categories of terma teachings are named: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span class="intro"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> 1.

are known as <i><span style="font-style:normal">earth terma</span></i>; the 
texts mystically concealed in space and appearing at a particular time to the 
destined master are called <i><span style="font-style:normal">space terma</span></i>; 
those which spontaneously arise in the clear light mind of a master's perfect 
meditative stability are called <i><span style="font-style:normal">mind terma</span></i>; 
and those which appear in the visionary experience of an undeluded and purified 
mind are called <i><span style="font-style:normal">pure vision terma</span></i>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span class="intro"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> 2.

doctrine and its commentaries are called <i><span style="font-style:normal"> dharma terma</span></i>; those that are in the form of rare and precious 
objects are called <i><span style="font-style:normal">valuable terma</span></i>; 
and those which consist of nectar, medicine, and so forth are called terma of
<i><span style="font-style:normal">sacred substances</span></i>. <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
<p class="style12"><span class="intro"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> 3.

revealed in front of others are called <i><span style="font-style:normal"> public terma</span></i>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span class="intro"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> 4.

called <i><span style="font-style:normal">major terma</span></i>; those which 
present methods for more minor accomplishments are called <i> <span style="font-style:normal">minor terma</span></i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span class="intro"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> 5.

direction: the ripened eastern treasure of fruit, the integrated southern 
treasure of the stem, the radiant western treasure of the flower, the dispersed 
northern treasure of the branches, and the deeply-rooted treasure of the center. 
Others such as those which contain instructions on the practice of the Three 
Roots are called <i><span style="font-style:normal">root terma</span></i>; 
those presenting such practices as Guru Yoga or Avalokiteshvara sadhanas, or 
pith instructions on the highest methods of Dzogpa Chenpo, are called <i> <span style="font-style:normal">fruit terma</span></i>; and there are myriad 
other inner sub-divisions of terma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> The Clarification of Misconceptions About Terma<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">There are some who criticize the terma teachings as 
just a mental fabrication of the Tibetans, and claim as their reason that no 
Indian antecedents can be found. Such is not the case, however, as there are 
many examples from India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Acharya Jampel Shenyen concealed all the oral 
teachings of tantric essence under the huge rock sealed on top by a crossed 
vajra to the northeast of Vajrasana (Bodh Gaya), India. Likewise, The Sutra on 
the Five Aggregates was concealed within the Pedra Retra Stupa. Once, while the 
Brahmin Demed Legnang was accompanying the Buddha along the way, there arose 
different sounds and lights from a protrusion of soil on the old stupa. The 
Buddha with his eyes full of tears prostrated and circumambulated it. When 
Vajrapani asked him about it, he said that there is the treasure of the essence 
within. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The Chinese version of the Lankavatara Sutra says 
that Madoepa, the King of Nagas, offered a conch shell to the Buddha, which was 
handed over to Maudgalyana with the command that he conceal it as a treasure at 
Mount Gogpa. There are numerous other examples. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Other criticism states that treasure teachings are 
not mentioned in either the Buddha's teaching or in the commentarial canon. This 
is also false. The All Surpassing Merit Gathering of the Concentrative Sutra 
reads, "Jampel, the four elements arise from the sky treasure. Likewise, all the 
virtuous teachings arise from the heart of the Buddha. Hence, make use of this 
treasure's purpose." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Further, The Concise Tantra of Supreme Bliss says: <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
<p class="style10"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> <span style="mso-tab-count:

<br /> <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You, Vajrapani, <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p> </i></span></p>
<p class="style11"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will extract from the treasury and bestow." <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Some persist in denying the validity of the 
treasure teachings, saying they are only found in the Nyingma tradition and not 
present in the newer traditions. On the contrary, we can find examples such as 
the Wrathful Mantra of Fourteen Syllables, which was revealed as a treasure in 
India by the translator Rinchen Dak, contained in the thirteen well-known golden 
volumes of the Sakyapas. Also, the great Master Tsongkhapa revealed the treasure 
of The Two Masks of Chogyal, and The Conch Shell, which was prophesied in the 
Chinese version of the Lankavatara Sutra. It's possible to find examples of 
terma in all Tibetan Buddhist traditions, including from the Fifth Dalai Lama. <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
<p class="style12"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> The Purpose of Terma<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Of the many reasons for the concealment and 
rediscovery of terma, the sublime master of the 18th century, Jigme Lingpa, 
highlights four: "...to maintain the doctrine's continuity, to avoid corrupted 
instructions, to keep the blessings intact, and to keep the lineage closer to 
the origin of the teachings." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Furthermore, the profound treasures upon their mere 
revelation are said to radiate blessings in the immediate area such that the 
strength of nonvirtue declines, virtue increases, and there is pacification of 
seasonal calamities, disease, famine, war, and so forth. The terma also clear 
the obstacles to longevity, and hindrances to the activities of the doctrine 
holders. In brief, they benefit everyone by enhancing the teachings, wealth, 
sacred substances, etc., and give rise to the four-fold liberation. Even at the 
end of this degenerate era, when the Vinaya doctrine of the sutras disappears, 
the secret tantric teachings of Vajrayana will still be propagated. Their 
continuity will cause vast benevolent activities to lead all the untamable 
beings to perfect liberation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">From the words of Guru Rinpoche: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> <span style="mso-tab-count:

doctrine to maintain the teachings in the degenerate era."
<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It is said that the liberating activities of the 
profound terma will not cease until the advent of Buddha Maitreya's teachings. <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
<p class="style12" align="center"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The Benefits of Receiving Empowerments<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">An authentic Vajra Master bestows empowerments by 
conducting a perfect ceremony for faithful and devoted disciples. Those 
recipients with sharp faculties realize the ultimate wisdom of the empowerment 
upon the mere bestowal; the mediocre ones begin experiencing wisdom; and those 
with inferior faculties develop mere understanding. Through tilling, hard, 
fallow ground can become soft earth, and then, by planting a seed and assembling 
the conditions of manure, heat, and moisture, slowly the sprout will grow until 
finally the fruit ripens. In the same way, disciples who previously lacked the 
ability to develop their qualities, like the hard, barren ground, are purified 
by empowerment, becoming suitable for the planting and growth of the seeds of 
the four kayas. In this case, the conditions are the exertions of effort on the 
path of generation and completion stage meditation related to that empowerment. 
Through this effort, with every single moment, grasping to the three doors [of 
body speech, and mind] and to their distinctness (which make four altogether), 
and obstructions such as karma, afflictions, and cognitive habitual tendencies, 
the four temporary obstructions, and so forth, are all gradually purified. The 
nature of the four paths of learning, the thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment, 
the ten perfections, and the two accumulations (of merit and wisdom)&mdash;intensified 
by the two stages of generation and completion'gradually develop. Finally, the 
four vajras of body, speech, mind, and wisdom; the four kayas; and other 
inherent qualities become evident as one is freed from obscurations and 
actualizes fruition. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Particularly, the importance of the empowerment for 
accomplishing the path of secret tantra is explained in The Luminous Essence, a 
commentary to the Guhyagarbha Tantra: "Briefly, the empowerment is the first and 
only door to the path of Vajrayana; it is a dynamic method that dominates the 
practice and the fruition. Relying upon this, the view of Vajrayana will arise 
in our mental continuum. Through practice in accordance with the view, one 
achieves capability in the vajra-conduct." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The empowerment makes the sadhana practice, 
offerings, activity, recitation of mantra, and gesture of mudra meaningful, and 
through it we obtain the samaya vows. Therefore, the empowerment is like the 
source of all. It is like the king who promotes one to ever greater positions. 
Each and every Vajrayana teaching is dependent upon empowerment. <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
<p class="style12"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In the ultimate reality, there is no bestowing and 
no receiving because the nature of all phenomena is the perfection of the 
Dharmakaya. With this realization, the self-awareness empowerment is 
simultaneously actualized, consummating all empowerments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
