<p class="schpeel">VENERABLE GYATRUL RINPOCHE<br /> RINCHEN TERZOD<br /><br />COMMENTS AND ADVICE<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /> A few days before the start of the Rinchen Terzod empowerments, Ven. Gyatrul Rinpoche visited the center and then called ODD, you can read some of his comments and advice below. <br /><br /> <b>Empowerment Substances:</b><br /><br /> Everyone needs to be very mindful and respectful of the empowerment substances. 
<img alt="Ven Gyatrul Rinpoche" style="float: right; border: 1px solid black; margin: 25px;" src="./images/Gyatrul_Rinpoche_Notecard_-_Front.jpg" height="275" width="220" />Empowerment substances are samaya substances. That means they are very heavy, good or bad, depending on how you treat them. Take them nicely, in your hand, respectfully, drink them, touch them to your head. Don't let them end up on the floor. Keep track of them carefully. Don't let the children run over them or treat them disrespectfully. This won't benefit them. If we are sloppy with the substances, we will send ourselves to the lower realms and make obstacles for ourselves. So be careful, for yourself, and parents should help the children be careful and take the empowerments nicely.<br /><br /> <b>Kids:</b><br /><br /> The children should not be running in the ten directions. It is the parents' job to watch them carefully so they don't distract anyone during the empowerments. It is the parents' job, their responsibility, but also everyone needs to watch because children are young, they are playing, they don't know. Don't let them disturb others' concentration, that's no good. No good for them, the children; of course not good for others. Parents, don't think, "I am taking empowerment!" and then not watch them nicely. They are your job. Also they are watching you, how you have respect, how you act during the empowerment.
<br /><br /> <b>During Empowerments:</b><br /><br /> This time is our connection to the Buddhas. We should turn our minds to the Three Jewels and work that way. We shouldn't do our usual work of creating more samsara. We shouldn't bring our ordinary lazy, sloppy way into the shrine room and how we treat the empowerment substances. That is great non-virtue. Be careful! Instead, fill your mind with faith and be humble, helpful, respectful. Pay attention to the chopons and so forth moving around you. But you don't need to move so much yourself, running here and there, sneaking around like a criminal. People don't need to be going always back and forth during the empowerments. For your own sake, the best thing is to sit quietly, body quietly, speech quietly, mind quietly with faith and pure view, clear, paying attention. That is how you will benefit yourself the most during the empowerments. When you receive empowerment, just receive empowerment. The idea of empowerment is not only in Vajrayana but in Mahayana, too. But in Vajrayana, and especially in the Ati teachings, empowerment is crucial. It is inconceivable. Therefore be careful in how you act during such a precious transmission.<br /><br /> <b>Then, via a phone call:</b><br /><br /> You there at the center, working day and night for the Rinchen Terdzod, thank you. Also there are so many expenses, thank to everyone for contributing to them. You are working hard and being generous with your time and your money, everything. In the future we will know that this is no small thing, the Rinchen Terdzod. Then we will see that everything we do for it is accumulating merit and purifying our obscurations. You do know this. This is a very powerful blessing. It will help us be free of disease and obstacles, and it is a vast way to accumulate merit and purify our obscurations, which is the heart of hearing, contemplating, and meditating on the dharma, the way to practice the path. You need to understand what empowerment and transmission are. They are not everyday work. They are not business as usual. If you engage in them with your body, speech, and mind, purely, then don't be thinking that in the future you will get a lot of money. Think instead that you will be able to perfect the accumulation of merit and purify all obscurations and negativity. This is only the second time this transmission has been given in America, and it is of great benefit to the whole country. From now until the Terdzod is finished, as much as you can please accumulate merit and purify obscurations. Please work for the benefit of all beings as much as you can.
<br /><br /> In the teachings that Khenpo Namdrol has been giving, Omniscient Longchenpa describes the qualities of enlightened mind with its twofold omniscience: the wisdom that knows the nature of all phenomena, and the wisdom that knows all phenomena as they appear. This twofold wisdom, the wisdom of enlightened mind, which is the wisdom of our own Buddhanature, is inconceivable. If we study the ngondro teachings, we will learn about the scope of samsara's sufferings. But we can free ourselves and others from all of these sufferings by following the Buddha's teachings. Those teachings reveal how we already possess this twofold omniscient wisdom. If we follow those teachings with all our hearts, we will not go wrong but will be of vast benefit to ourselves and others by coming to know that wisdom that we already possess. If we have some understanding of the workings of karma, of what is virtuous, if we some sense of the qualities of the Three Jewels, then receiving empowerment, transmission, and instruction from a qualified master will be meaningful. For myself, I went to many empowerments and received so many teachings and blessings but I don't even know what they are, much less their meaning! So don't be like me.
<br /><br /> Right now everyone has been coming together and working very well, and the center looks beautiful, a worthy setting for such an auspicious event. This is your kindness, the kindness of all the people who offered their time and money, their work and bodies. Also this is your merit, this is your purification and your accumulation. Everyone should be aware as they work or contribute of what they are contributing to, which is the benefit of all beings, and dedicate their merit with aspirational prayers that all be enlightened as one mandala and realize the qualities of Guru Rinpoche and Vimalamitra. Our lama, Yangthang Tulku, is an incarnation of Vimalamitra. You can read about his qualities and compassion. Therefore he is eminently suitable to give this transmission.
<br /><br /> You can look at the outline of the Rinchen Terdzod and learn about its different stages. You might think that there is too much! But actually all the different levels of dharma are rich or busy in this same way: the path of individual liberation, the path of the bodhisattvas, the path of Vajrayana, the unsurpassable path with its empowerment, transmission and instruction--purifying obscurations and accumulating merit is not easy! You might get tired and think, "I'm so exhausted!" and so forth. But actually you are a little tired now, maybe, but it is meaningful for this whole life. We are here when the Terdzod being given, and we have the freedom to attend and clear minds to focus on its blessing. What inconceivable aspirations we must have made in the past to encounter such a circumstance! Don't waste this merit.
<br /><br /> Remember the amazing qualities of this lama, of this dharma. You do know them. Then whatever effort we can offer in their service, that is our chance to connect to the power of their blessing. We should remember this in whatever great or small, easy or difficult work we do for this event. Whatever work you do, do with faith and devotion. It isn't ordinary work; it is for the benefit of all. You have received so many teachings from Khenpo Namdrol Rinpoche and many other lamas. By their kindness, you have some understanding of how to benefit yourself and others. Don't be selfish. Don't be stingy with your body, speech, and mind. Now is not the time to be stingy. Be generous with your compassion. Be generous with your wisdom. If this is our attitude, then one minute of work is meaningful, is inconceivable. It is our opportunity to make the most of this life, whether making offerings to the sublime ones or being generous to those in need. Please keep this in mind as much as you can.
<br /><br /> Now the center is looking really nice, and not only the paint and the new TV and fancy chairs. Now people are really starting to work together, helping and respecting each other. This is amazing! How wonderful! Finally you are all getting good. If you work together like this, then your merit will grow. You increase your merit by helping each other. And then you make something pleasing. That is how you accumulate merit. If something is made through negativity and the poisons, then if you like it, it is of no benefit. The poisons are the great negativity; nothing good can come from them. But if something is made through kindness and harmony, then it is pleasing. Then the merit is inconceivable, not tiny like the thing you have made itself, but vast like space.</p>
