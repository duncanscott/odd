        Lama Drimed will give brief teachings on the development of compassion and lead guided
        meditations including the recitation of the six syllable mantra,
        Om Mani Padme Hung. This mantra is considered to be the essence of compassion and is the
        most ubiquitous in Tibetan Buddhism.  New students, experienced practitioners
        and people just curious about meditation are all encouraged to attend.
